# Database Index Performance Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the index strategy and performance analysis for the Airbnb database system. We've identified high-usage columns and created appropriate indexes to optimize query performance.

## Indexes Created

### Users Table
- `idx_users_user_id`: Index on `user_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize JOIN operations with bookings table
  - Usage: Frequently used in JOIN conditions
- `idx_users_first_name`: Index on `first_name`
  - Purpose: Optimize GROUP BY and SELECT operations
  - Usage: Used in user listing and aggregation queries

### Bookings Table
- `idx_bookings_user_id`: Index on `user_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize JOIN operations with users table
  - Usage: Critical for user-booking relationships
- `idx_bookings_property_id`: Index on `property_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize JOIN operations with properties table
  - Usage: Essential for property-booking relationships
- `idx_bookings_booking_id`: Index on `booking_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize COUNT operations and primary key lookups
  - Usage: Used in aggregation queries

### Properties Table
- `idx_properties_property_id`: Index on `property_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize JOIN operations and primary key lookups
  - Usage: Critical for property-related queries
- `idx_properties_name`: Index on `name`
  - Purpose: Optimize ORDER BY and SELECT operations
  - Usage: Used in property listing and sorting

### Reviews Table
- `idx_reviews_property_id`: Index on `property_id`
  - Purpose: Optimize JOIN operations with properties table
  - Usage: Essential for property-review relationships
- `idx_reviews_rating`: Index on `rating`
  - Purpose: Optimize WHERE conditions and aggregations
  - Usage: Used in rating-based queries and calculations

## Performance Measurement

### Property Ranking Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name as property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) as row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) as rank_num
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;
```

### User Bookings Count Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    users.first_name,
    COUNT(bookings.user_id) as bookings_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN bookings ON users.user_id = bookings.user_id
GROUP BY users.first_name;
```

## How to Interpret EXPLAIN ANALYZE Output

When analyzing the EXPLAIN ANALYZE output, look for these key indicators:

1. **Execution Time**
   - Compare the total execution time before and after adding indexes
   - Look for significant reductions in planning and execution time

2. **Scan Types**
   - `Index Scan`: Indicates the query is using an index (good)
   - `Sequential Scan`: Indicates full table scan (may need optimization)
   - `Bitmap Index Scan`: Combination of index and sequential scan

3. **Join Methods**
   - `Hash Join`: Good for larger datasets
   - `Nested Loop`: Efficient for small datasets
   - `Merge Join`: Effective for sorted data

4. **Memory Usage**
   - Check if the query is using excessive memory
   - Look for opportunities to optimize memory usage

## Best Practices

1. **Index Maintenance**
   - Regularly monitor index usage
   - Remove unused indexes
   - Update statistics for optimal query planning

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Use appropriate JOIN types
   - Limit the number of rows returned
   - Use WHERE clauses effectively

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Regularly run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on critical queries
   - Monitor index usage patterns
   - Adjust indexes based on changing query patterns
