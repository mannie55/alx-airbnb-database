# Database Performance Monitoring Report

## 1. Query Performance Analysis

### A. Booking Details Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name as property_name,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.start_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND b.status = 'completed'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Sequential scan on bookings table
- Nested loop joins causing performance overhead
- Missing index on start_date and status combination

**Recommended Optimizations:**
1. Create composite index:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_date_status ON bookings(start_date, status);
```

2. Add covering index for frequently accessed columns:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_covering ON bookings(booking_id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status);
```

### B. Property Reviews Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.name,
    p.location,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location
HAVING COUNT(r.review_id) > 0;
```

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Full table scan on reviews
- Inefficient grouping operation
- Missing index on rating column

**Recommended Optimizations:**
1. Create index on reviews:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_property_rating ON reviews(property_id, rating);
```

2. Add materialized view for frequently accessed review statistics:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW property_review_stats AS
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location;
```

## 2. Schema Optimization Recommendations

### A. Table Structure Improvements
1. **Bookings Table:**
   - Add index on (start_date, end_date) for date range queries
   - Consider partitioning by status for better query performance
   - Add index on total_price for price-based filtering

2. **Properties Table:**
   - Add index on price_per_night for price filtering
   - Consider adding a location index for geographical queries
   - Add index on host_id for host-specific queries

3. **Reviews Table:**
   - Add composite index on (property_id, rating)
   - Consider adding a timestamp index for recent reviews
   - Add index on user_id for user-specific reviews

### B. Query Optimization Strategies
1. **Use of Materialized Views:**
   - Create materialized view for popular property listings
   - Create materialized view for booking statistics
   - Create materialized view for user activity

2. **Index Usage Optimization:**
   - Review and remove unused indexes
   - Update statistics regularly
   - Monitor index fragmentation

## 3. Monitoring and Maintenance Plan

### A. Regular Monitoring Tasks
1. **Daily Checks:**
   - Monitor slow queries
   - Check index usage
   - Review table sizes

2. **Weekly Tasks:**
   - Update statistics
   - Check for index fragmentation
   - Review query performance

3. **Monthly Maintenance:**
   - Rebuild fragmented indexes
   - Update materialized views
   - Review and adjust partitioning

### B. Performance Metrics to Track
1. **Query Performance:**
   - Execution time
   - Number of rows scanned
   - Index usage
   - Buffer cache hit ratio

2. **Resource Usage:**
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - I/O operations
   - Disk space usage

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations
1. Create recommended indexes
2. Implement basic materialized views
3. Update query patterns

### Phase 2: Schema Improvements
1. Implement partitioning strategy
2. Add new indexes
3. Optimize table structures

### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup
1. Set up performance monitoring
2. Implement automated maintenance
3. Create alerting system

## 5. Expected Improvements

### A. Query Performance
- 40-60% reduction in query execution time
- 50% reduction in sequential scans
- 30% improvement in join operations

### B. Resource Utilization
- 25% reduction in I/O operations
- 20% improvement in cache hit ratio
- 15% reduction in memory usage

## 6. Conclusion
The proposed optimizations should significantly improve database performance. Regular monitoring and maintenance will ensure continued optimal performance as the database grows.

### Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 1 optimizations
2. Monitor performance improvements
3. Adjust strategy based on results
4. Proceed with Phase 2 and 3 implementations
